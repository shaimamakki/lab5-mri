# Introduction

# 

# This project is my Lab 5 work for MRI Tumor Detection.  

# The main idea was to take raw MRI images, clean them, extract useful information from them, train a machine learning model, and finally register the model in Azure ML.

# 

# I tried to keep the whole project clear and organized, moving through the Bronze → Silver → Gold workflow.

# 

# This README explains everything I did in normal, easy language.
