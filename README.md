# Introduction 
The main idea was to take raw MRI images, clean them, extract useful information from them, train a machine learning model, and finally register the model in Azure ML.
BUT, I tried creating notebooks and features extraction using Azure ML and could not do it because it kep asking for some permissions and stuff. I even created my compute instance and cluster still couldnt work. So, rather I did everything using Databricks.I tried to keep the whole project clear and organized, moving through the Bronze → Silver → Gold workflow. A proper lakehouse structure.
